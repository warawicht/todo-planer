## Implemented Endpoints

The following authentication endpoints have been implemented:

1. `POST /auth/register` - User registration
2. `POST /auth/login` - User login
3. `GET /auth/verify-email` - Email verification
4. `POST /auth/forgot-password` - Forgot password
5. `POST /auth/reset-password` - Reset password
6. `POST /auth/logout` - User logout
7. `POST /auth/refresh` - Token refresh
8. `GET /auth/profile` - Get user profile
9. `PUT /auth/profile` - Update user profile
10. `POST /auth/unlock-account/:userId` - Unlock user account (admin)

## Technologies Used

- **Framework**: NestJS (Node.js framework with TypeScript support)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with RS256 asymmetric encryption
