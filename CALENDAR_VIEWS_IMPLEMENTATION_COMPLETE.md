# Calendar Views Implementation - COMPLETE

This document confirms that all tasks for implementing calendar views functionality in the todo-planer application have been successfully completed.

## Implementation Status

✅ **All tasks completed successfully**

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Calendar DTOs
- `CalendarViewQueryDto` - For querying calendar views
- `CalendarTimeBlockDto` - For representing time blocks in calendar views
- `CalendarViewResponseDto` - For calendar view responses

### 2. Services
All performance optimization services have been implemented:
- `DateRangeCalculatorService` - Calculates date ranges for different views
- `CalendarDataAggregatorService` - Aggregates and formats data for calendar views
- `CalendarCacheService` - Caches calendar view data for performance
- `DateNavigationService` - Handles date navigation logic
- `VirtualScrollingService` - Implements virtual scrolling for large datasets
- `NavigationDebounceService` - Adds debouncing to navigation controls
- `RequestCancellationService` - Handles request cancellation for rapid navigation
- `PerformanceMonitoringService` - Monitors rendering performance
- `LazyLoadingService` - Implements lazy loading techniques
- `EnhancedCacheService` - Provides sophisticated caching strategies
- `MobileOptimizationService` - Optimizes for mobile performance

### 3. Controllers
- Extended `TimeBlocksController` with calendar endpoints:
  - `GET /time-blocks/calendar/view` - Get calendar view data
  - `GET /time-blocks/calendar/navigation` - Get navigation data

### 4. Entities
- `CalendarViewPreference` - Stores user calendar view preferences

### 5. Users Module
- Extended `UsersService` with preference methods
- Extended `UsersController` with preference endpoints:
  - `GET /users/:id/calendar-preference` - Get user calendar preference
  - `PUT /users/:id/calendar-preference` - Update user calendar preference

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. Components
- `Calendar` - Main calendar component that coordinates views
- `DayView` - Day view component with time slots and time blocks
- `WeekView` - Week view component with daily columns
- `MonthView` - Month view component with daily cells

### 2. Hooks
- `useCalendar` - Custom hook for calendar state management and data fetching

### 3. Services
- `CalendarService` - Service layer for API communication

### 4. Types
- TypeScript types for calendar views, time blocks, and preferences

### 5. Utilities
- Date utility functions for calculations and formatting
