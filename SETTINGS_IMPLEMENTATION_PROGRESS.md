# Settings and Customization Feature Implementation Progress

## Completed Planning Phase

The planning phase for the Settings and Customization feature has been completed successfully. The following artifacts have been created:

1. **SETTINGS_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md** - A comprehensive checklist of all tasks required for implementation
2. **SETTINGS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** - A detailed implementation plan following the project's architecture
3. **SETTINGS_REQUIREMENTS_MAPPING.md** - A mapping of requirements to implementation tasks and test cases

## Completed Tasks

### Module Structure and Organization
- ✅ Created settings directory structure under src/
- ✅ Established entities, dto, services, and controllers directories
- ✅ Created settings.module.ts file
- ✅ Verified directory structure matches project conventions

## Pending Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Entity Implementation (Database Layer)
- Implement Theme Preference entity and generate migration
- Implement Timezone Preference entity and generate migration
- Implement Profile Preference entity and generate migration
- Implement Data Export entity and generate migration

### Phase 2: Data Transfer Objects (DTO Layer)
- Create Theme Preference DTOs with validation
- Create Timezone Preference DTOs with validation
- Create Profile Preference DTOs with validation
- Create Data Export DTOs with validation

### Phase 3: Business Logic (Service Layer)
- Implement Theme Preference service with CRUD operations
- Implement Timezone Preference service with CRUD operations
- Implement Profile Preference service with CRUD operations
- Implement Data Export service with export functionality

### Phase 4: API Endpoints (Controller Layer)
- Implement Theme Preference controller with GET/PUT endpoints
- Implement Timezone Preference controller with GET/PUT endpoints
- Implement Profile Preference controller with GET/PUT/POST endpoints
- Implement Data Export controller with POST/GET endpoints

### Phase 5: Integration and Security
- Add authentication guards to protect all settings endpoints
- Implement file upload functionality for avatar uploads
- Integrate with existing Notification Preference system

### Phase 6: Performance Optimization
- Implement caching for frequently accessed settings
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing

### Phase 7: Testing
- Create unit tests for all services
- Create integration tests for all API endpoints
- Verify authentication requirements for all endpoints
- Test error handling in all services

### Phase 8: Documentation and Deployment
- Create documentation for all settings API endpoints
- Update application module to include settings module
- Perform security review of settings implementation
- Conduct performance testing of settings features
- Prepare for code review and deployment

## Implementation Approach

The implementation will follow the established patterns in the codebase:
1. Create entities using TypeORM with proper relationships to the User entity
2. Create DTOs with validation using class-validator
3. Implement services with business logic and proper error handling
4. Create controllers with RESTful API endpoints protected by authentication
5. Generate database migrations for schema changes
6. Implement comprehensive testing including unit and integration tests

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of Theme Preference entity
2. Continue with other entities in parallel
3. Develop DTOs alongside entities
4. Implement services and controllers
5. Create comprehensive test suite
6. Document API endpoints
7. Conduct security and performance reviews

This implementation plan provides a clear roadmap for delivering the Settings and Customization feature while maintaining code quality and following project conventions.
