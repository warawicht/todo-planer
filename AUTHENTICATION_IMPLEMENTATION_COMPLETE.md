# Authentication System Implementation - Complete

## Overview

The authentication system for the NestJS application has been successfully implemented with all core functionality completed. The system provides a comprehensive set of features for user registration, authentication, session management, and security.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Core Authentication Structure

- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Redis setup for token blacklisting and rate limiting
- ✅ Security headers and cookie settings
- ✅ Unit tests for authentication service
- ✅ Integration tests for API endpoints
- ✅ API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger

### 2. User Registration with Email Verification
- ✅ Register endpoint (/auth/register) with POST method
- ✅ Email format validation
- ✅ Password strength validation (min 8 chars, mixed case, numbers, special chars)
- ✅ Duplicate email address checking
- ✅ Password hashing using bcrypt with salt rounds >= 12
- ✅ User record creation in database
- ✅ Email verification token generation
- ✅ Verification token storage in database
- ✅ Success response with user data and verification prompt

### 3. User Login with JWT Authentication
- ✅ Login endpoint (/auth/login) with POST method
- ✅ User credentials validation against stored data
- ✅ Account lockout check before authentication
- ✅ Password verification using bcrypt
- ✅ Failed login attempt handling (account lockout after 5 failed attempts)
- ✅ Failed attempts counter reset on successful login
- ✅ Last login timestamp update
- ✅ JWT access token generation (15 min expiration)
- ✅ JWT refresh token generation (30 days expiration)
- ✅ Refresh token storage in database
- ✅ Token return to client with proper security headers

### 4. Password Reset Functionality
- ✅ Forgot-password endpoint (/auth/forgot-password) with POST method
- ✅ Reset-password endpoint (/auth/reset-password) with POST method
- ✅ Email address format validation
- ✅ User existence check with provided email
- ✅ Password reset token generation
- ✅ Token expiration setting (24 hours)
- ✅ Reset token storage in database
- ✅ Success response
- ✅ Reset token validation when user clicks link
- ✅ Token expiration check
- ✅ New password strength validation
- ✅ New password hashing using bcrypt
- ✅ User password update in database
- ✅ Token deletion/reset from database
- ✅ Success response

### 5. Secure Logout Mechanism
- ✅ Logout endpoint (/auth/logout) with POST method
- ✅ Access token validation
- ✅ User ID extraction from token
- ✅ Refresh token revocation in database
- ✅ Client cookie clearing
- ✅ Success response

### 6. Session Management with Refresh Tokens
- ✅ Refresh endpoint (/auth/refresh) with POST method
- ✅ Refresh token validation
- ✅ Token expiration check
- ✅ Token revocation check
- ✅ Current token blacklisting
- ✅ New access token generation (15 min expiration)
- ✅ New refresh token generation (30 days expiration)
- ✅ New refresh token storage in database
- ✅ New tokens return to client with proper security headers

### 7. Rate Limiting
- ✅ Rate limiting middleware
- ✅ Rate limits configuration (e.g., 10 requests/minute)
- ✅ IP-based rate limiting
- ✅ User-based rate limiting
- ✅ Different limits for different endpoints
- ✅ Rate limit exceeded response
- ✅ Automatic rate limit reset after time window

### 8. Account Lockout
- ✅ Failed login attempt counter in User entity
- ✅ Failed login attempts tracking
- ✅ Lockout after 5 failed attempts
- ✅ Lockout duration setting (e.g., 30 minutes)
- ✅ Automatic unlock after time period
- ✅ Admin unlock capability
- ✅ Manual unlock by admin

## Technologies Used

- **Framework**: NestJS (Node.js framework with TypeScript support)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with RS256 asymmetric encryption
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with TypeORM
- **Token Storage**: Redis for refresh token blacklisting and rate limiting
- **Encryption**: bcrypt for password hashing
- **Rate Limiting**: Custom Redis-based implementation
- **Validation**: class-validator for input validation

## Security Features

- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Password hashing with bcrypt (salt rounds >= 12)
- Account lockout after 5 failed login attempts
- Rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- HTTP-only, Secure, SameSite cookies
- Input validation and sanitization
- Email verification for new accounts
- Password reset functionality with time-limited tokens

## Implemented Endpoints

1. `POST /auth/register` - User registration
2. `POST /auth/login` - User login
3. `GET /auth/verify-email` - Email verification
4. `POST /auth/forgot-password` - Forgot password
5. `POST /auth/reset-password` - Reset password
6. `POST /auth/logout` - User logout
7. `POST /auth/refresh` - Token refresh
8. `GET /auth/profile` - Get user profile
9. `PUT /auth/profile` - Update user profile
10. `POST /auth/unlock-account/:userId` - Unlock user account (admin)

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive unit tests and integration tests covering:
- Authentication service functionality
- API endpoint validation
- Rate limiting behavior
- Account lockout mechanisms
- Edge case handling

## Deployment

The authentication system is ready for deployment with proper environment configuration for:
- Database connections
- Redis connections
- JWT secret management
- Email service integration (placeholder functions exist)

## Next Steps

To fully operationalize the system, the following steps are recommended:
1. Configure email service credentials for sending verification and notification emails
2. Set up production environment variables
3. Configure Redis for production use
4. Run comprehensive security testing
5. Implement monitoring and logging for authentication events
