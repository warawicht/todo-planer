# Time Blocking Feature Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Time Blocking feature based on the design requirements.

## Completed Implementation Tasks

### 1. Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
- [x] CreateTimeBlockDto - For creating new time blocks with validation
- [x] UpdateTimeBlockDto - For updating existing time blocks (partial updates)
- [x] TimeBlockQueryDto - For filtering time blocks by date range

### 2. Entity Implementation
- [x] TimeBlock Entity - Fully implemented with all required fields and validations
- [x] Entity relationships with User and Task entities
- [x] Validation rules for title, description, color format, and time ranges
- [x] Database indexes for performance optimization

### 3. Service Layer
- [x] TimeBlocksService - Complete implementation with business logic
- [x] Time block creation with conflict detection
- [x] Time block retrieval with filtering capabilities
- [x] Time block updates with conflict re-checking
- [x] Time block deletion with proper ownership verification
- [x] Conflict detection algorithm implementation
- [x] User ownership verification for all operations

### 4. Controller Layer
- [x] TimeBlocksController - REST API endpoints implementation
- [x] JWT authentication protection for all endpoints
- [x] POST /time-blocks - Create new time blocks
- [x] GET /time-blocks - Retrieve time blocks with optional filtering
- [x] GET /time-blocks/:id - Retrieve specific time block
- [x] PATCH /time-blocks/:id - Update existing time block
- [x] DELETE /time-blocks/:id - Delete time block

### 5. Exception Handling
- [x] TimeBlockConflictException - Custom exception for time conflicts
- [x] Proper HTTP status codes (409 for conflicts, 404 for not found, etc.)

### 6. Testing
- [x] Unit tests for TimeBlocksService
- [x] Unit tests for TimeBlocksController
- [x] Entity validation tests
- [x] Integration tests (e2e) for all API endpoints
- [x] Edge case testing for conflict detection

## Remaining Implementation Tasks

### 1. Frontend Implementation (UI)
- [ ] Time Block Calendar UI Component
- [ ] Calendar Header Component
- [ ] Calendar Grid Component
- [ ] Time Block Card Component
- [ ] Time Block Form Component
- [ ] Conflict Warning Component
- [ ] Task Link Component

### 2. Advanced Features
- [ ] Recurrence Pattern Implementation
- [ ] Time Zone Handling
- [ ] Performance Optimization for Large Data Sets
- [ ] Reporting Integration for Linked Tasks

## API Endpoints Implemented

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Authentication |
|----------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| /time-blocks | POST | Create a new time block | Required (JWT) |
| /time-blocks | GET | Retrieve time blocks with optional filtering | Required (JWT) |
| /time-blocks/:id | GET | Retrieve a specific time block | Required (JWT) |
| /time-blocks/:id | PATCH | Update an existing time block | Required (JWT) |
| /time-blocks/:id | DELETE | Delete a time block | Required (JWT) |

## Validation Rules Implemented

1. Title: 1-100 characters
2. Description: 0-500 characters
3. Color: Valid hex color code format (#RRGGBB)
4. Time Range: Start time must be before end time
5. Conflict Detection: No overlapping time blocks for the same user
6. User Ownership: Users can only access their own time blocks
7. Task Linking: Valid task ID when linking to tasks

## Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests
- Time block creation with validation
- Conflict detection scenarios
- Time block retrieval with filtering
- Time block updates with conflict re-checking
- Time block deletion with ownership verification

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end API workflow testing
- Authentication requirement validation
- Data validation testing
- Conflict detection integration
- Response format verification

### Edge Cases Covered
- Invalid time ranges
- Overlapping time blocks
- Non-existent time block IDs
- Invalid color codes
- Missing required fields
- Concurrent operations
- Database constraints
