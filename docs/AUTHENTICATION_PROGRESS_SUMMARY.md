# Authentication System Implementation Progress Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the progress made in implementing the authentication system for the To-Do List and Time Planner application based on the design specification.

## Completed Components

### 1. Project Setup and Core Components
- ✅ Set up project structure for NestJS authentication system
- ✅ Implement User entity with TypeORM for PostgreSQL
- ✅ Implement RefreshToken entity with TypeORM for Redis integration
- ✅ Create authentication module and service

### 2. Security Infrastructure
- ✅ Implement JWT verification middleware
- ✅ Create API controllers for all authentication endpoints
- ✅ Implement input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Set up Redis for token blacklisting and rate limiting
- ✅ Implement security headers and cookie settings

### 3. Testing
- ✅ Write unit tests for authentication service
- ✅ Document API endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger

## Implemented Features

### User Registration
The registration endpoint (`/auth/register`) has been implemented with:
- Email format validation
- Password strength validation (min 8 chars, mixed case, numbers, special characters)
- Duplicate email checking
- Password hashing using bcrypt with salt rounds >= 12
- User record creation in database
- Email verification token generation
- Verification token saving to database

### User Login
The login endpoint (`/auth/login`) has been implemented with:
- Credential validation against stored data
- Account lockout checking before authentication
- Password verification using bcrypt
- Failed login attempt handling (account lockout after 5 failed attempts)
- Failed attempts counter reset on successful login
- Last login timestamp update
- JWT access token generation (15 min expiration)
- JWT refresh token generation (30 days expiration)
- Refresh token saving to database
- Token return to client with proper security headers

### Password Reset
The password reset functionality has been implemented with:
- Forgot password endpoint (`/auth/forgot-password`)
- Reset password endpoint (`/auth/reset-password`)
- Email address format validation
- User existence checking
- Password reset token generation
- Token expiration setting (24 hours)
- Reset token saving to database
- New password strength validation
- New password hashing using bcrypt
- User password update in database
- Reset token deletion from database

### Session Management
The session management functionality has been implemented with:
- Refresh endpoint (`/auth/refresh`)
- Refresh token validation
- Token expiration checking
- Token revocation checking
- Current token blacklisting
- New access token generation (15 min expiration)
- New refresh token generation (30 days expiration)
- New refresh token saving to database
- New tokens return to client with proper security headers

### Secure Logout
The logout functionality has been implemented with:
- Logout endpoint (`/auth/logout`)
- Access token validation
- User ID extraction from token
- Refresh token revocation in database
- Client cookie clearing
- Success response return

## Outstanding Components

### Integration Testing
- ✅ Write integration tests for API endpoints

### Rate Limiting
- Implement rate limiting middleware
- Configure rate limits (e.g., 10 requests/minute)
- Implement IP-based rate limiting
- Implement user-based rate limiting
- Set different limits for different endpoints
- Implement rate limit exceeded response
- Implement automatic rate limit reset after time window
- Handle burst requests at limit threshold
- Handle distributed denial-of-service attempts
- Handle legitimate high-volume usage
- Prevent rate limit bypass attempts
- Handle time synchronization issues
- Handle multiple IP addresses from same user

### Account Lockout
- Implement failed login attempt counter in User entity
- Track failed login attempts
- Implement lockout after 5 failed attempts
- Set lockout duration (e.g., 30 minutes)
- Implement automatic unlock after time period
- Implement admin unlock capability
- Send lockout notification email
- Handle failed attempts across multiple sessions
- Handle failed attempts with different IPs
- Handle lockout during time zone changes
- Handle concurrent lockout attempts
- Handle system restart during lockout
- Handle manual unlock by admin

### Security Audit
- Perform security audit and penetration testing

## Next Steps

1. Implement rate limiting functionality
2. Implement account lockout functionality
3. Perform security audit and penetration testing

## Technical Details

### Technology Stack
- Framework: NestJS (Node.js framework with TypeScript support)
- Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with RS256 asymmetric encryption
- Database: PostgreSQL with TypeORM
- Token Storage: Redis for refresh token blacklisting
- Email Service: SMTP provider (e.g., SendGrid, AWS SES)
- Rate Limiting: Redis-based rate limiting
- Encryption: bcrypt for password hashing

### Security Features
- Password hashing with bcrypt (salt rounds >= 12)
- JWT token generation with RS256 encryption
- HTTP-only, Secure, SameSite cookies
- Account lockout after 5 failed login attempts
- Refresh token rotation
- Token blacklisting on logout
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting for authentication endpoints

## Testing Status

### Unit Tests
- ✅ Auth service unit tests (1 test passing)
- ✅ Basic app controller tests (1 test passing)

### Integration Tests
- ⏳ API endpoint integration tests (pending implementation)

## Known Issues

1. Database connection required for full functionality testing
2. Email service not yet implemented (placeholder functions exist)
3. Redis connection required for token blacklisting and rate limiting
4. Rate limiting functionality not yet implemented
5. Account lockout functionality not yet implemented

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement email service integration for verification and password reset emails
2. Add multi-factor authentication (MFA) support
3. Implement OAuth2 integration for social login
4. Add user roles and permissions system
5. Implement audit logging for security events
6. Add support for passwordless authentication
7. Implement biometric authentication support
