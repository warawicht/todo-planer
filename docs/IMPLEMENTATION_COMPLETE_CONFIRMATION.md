## Final Status

**ðŸŽ‰ ALL TASKS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY ðŸŽ‰**

The calendar views feature is fully implemented, tested, and ready for production use. All backend APIs are functional, frontend components are complete, performance optimizations are in place, and comprehensive testing has been completed.

The implementation includes all features specified in the original requirements:
- Complete calendar views (day/week/month)
- User preference management
- Performance optimizations for large datasets
- Mobile optimization
- Keyboard navigation
- Responsive design
- Comprehensive error handling
- Full test coverage

This implementation provides a robust, scalable, and performant calendar views system that enhances the todo-planer application with powerful scheduling capabilities.
