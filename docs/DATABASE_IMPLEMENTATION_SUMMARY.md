# Database Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the database schema for the To-Do List and Time Planner application.

## Overview

The database implementation includes five main entities:
1. Users (already implemented)
2. Tasks
3. Projects
4. Tags
5. TimeBlocks

Each entity has been implemented with proper relationships, constraints, and indexes for optimal performance.

## Implementation Details

### Tasks Entity
- Implemented with all required fields: title, description, dueDate, priority, status, etc.
- Relationships with Users, Projects, Tags, and TimeBlocks
- Validation constraints for priority (0-4) and status values
- Cascade delete with Users, SET NULL with Projects

### Projects Entity
- Implemented with all required fields: name, description, color, isArchived, etc.
- Relationships with Users and Tasks
- Validation for color format (hex codes)
- Cascade delete with Users, SET NULL with Tasks

### Tags Entity
- Implemented with all required fields: name, color, etc.
- Relationships with Users and Tasks (many-to-many)
- Validation for color format (hex codes)
- Cascade delete with Users

### TimeBlocks Entity
- Implemented with all required fields: title, description, startTime, endTime, etc.
- Relationships with Users and Tasks
- Validation for time constraints (endTime must be after startTime)
- Cascade delete with Users, SET NULL with Tasks

## Database Relationships

All relationships have been implemented as specified in the design document:
- Users to Tasks (one-to-many, cascade delete)
- Users to Projects (one-to-many, cascade delete)
- Users to Tags (one-to-many, cascade delete)
- Users to TimeBlocks (one-to-many, cascade delete)
- Projects to Tasks (one-to-many, SET NULL)
- Tasks to Tags (many-to-many through task_tags junction table)
- Tasks to TimeBlocks (one-to-many, SET NULL)

## Indexes

The following indexes have been created for performance optimization:
- Composite index on Tasks (userId, status)
- Composite index on Tasks (userId, dueDate)
- Index on Tasks (projectId)
- Composite index on Projects (userId, isArchived)
- Composite index on Tags (userId, name)
- Composite index on TimeBlocks (userId, startTime, endTime)
- Index on TimeBlocks (taskId)

## Migration

A migration script has been created to set up all tables, relationships, and indexes:
- File: src/migrations/1724785200000-CreateTaskManagementTables.ts
- Includes both up and down methods for proper migration management

## Testing

Basic entity tests have been created to verify the implementation:
- Task entity tests
- Project entity tests
- Tag entity tests
- TimeBlock entity tests
- Integration tests for task management functionality

## Modules

Each entity has its own module with proper NestJS structure:
- Tasks module with controller, service, and entity
- Projects module with controller, service, and entity
- Tags module with controller, service, and entity
- TimeBlocks module with controller, service, and entity

## Configuration

The database configuration has been updated to include all new entities:
- Updated data-source.ts to include Task, Project, Tag, and TimeBlock entities
- Updated app.module.ts to include all new modules

## Usage

To run the database migration:
```bash
npm run migration:run
```

To revert the last migration:
```bash
npm run migration:revert
```

## Future Considerations

1. Add more comprehensive validation for recurrence patterns in TimeBlocks
2. Implement additional indexes based on query patterns
3. Add more extensive integration tests
4. Consider partitioning for large datasets
5. Implement database monitoring and alerting
