# Authentication System Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Authentication System based on the design specification and requirements checklist.

## Overview

The Authentication System provides secure user registration, login, session management, and access control for the To-Do List and Time Planner application. This implementation follows industry-standard security practices including JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens, email verification, password reset functionality, and robust security measures.
