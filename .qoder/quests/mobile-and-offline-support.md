# Mobile and Offline Support

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the design for implementing mobile and offline support in the todo-planer application. The goal is to provide users with a seamless experience across devices, especially when they have limited or no internet connectivity.

### 1.1 Goals

- Implement responsive design for all screen sizes
- Enable offline data access and modification
- Provide automatic synchronization when connectivity is restored
- Support Progressive Web App (PWA) installation
- Ensure data consistency across devices

### 1.1 Objectives

- Implement responsive mobile design for all application views
- Enable offline data storage and synchronization
- Add Progressive Web App (PWA) features for installability and offline functionality
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility and performance optimization

### 1.2 User Stories

1. As a user on the go, I want to access my tasks from a mobile device so that I can manage my schedule anywhere
2. As a user with intermittent connectivity, I want to use the app offline so that I can continue being productive
3. As a user who works across devices, I want my changes to sync when I reconnect so that my data stays consistent

## 2. Architecture

### 2.1 System Components

The mobile and offline support implementation involves three main components:

1. **Frontend Layer**: Handles responsive UI rendering, service workers for offline functionality, local storage management, and data synchronization services.

2. **Backend Layer**: Provides API endpoints for data synchronization, implements conflict detection and resolution mechanisms, and manages data versioning for sync reconciliation.

3. **Data Layer**: Manages client-side database operations using IndexedDB, implements caching strategies, and provides data conflict resolution algorithms.

### 2.2 Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Service Workers, IndexedDB
- **Backend**: NestJS with TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Offline Storage**: IndexedDB with localForage library
- **Sync Mechanism**: Custom conflict resolution algorithm
- **PWA Features**: Web App Manifest, Service Workers

## 3. Mobile Design Implementation

### 3.1 Responsive UI Components

#### 3.1.1 Component Adaptation
- Calendar views (Day, Week, Month) will be optimized for touch interfaces
- Touch-friendly navigation with appropriate sizing
- Mobile-optimized menus and controls
- Adaptive layouts for various screen sizes

#### 3.1.2 Performance Optimization
- Lazy loading for calendar events
- Virtual scrolling for large datasets
- Reduced data payloads for mobile connections
- Image optimization and compression

### 3.2 Touch Interface Enhancements
- Gesture recognition for common actions (swipe to complete, drag to reschedule)
- Larger touch targets for mobile usability
- Context menus optimized for touch interaction
- Haptic feedback for important actions

## 4. Offline Data Storage

### 4.1 Data Model for Offline Storage

The offline storage will mirror the essential entities needed for offline functionality:

Offline data entities will mirror the essential properties of the main entities with additional fields for version tracking and sync status.

### 4.2 Storage Strategy

#### 4.2.1 IndexedDB Schema
- Tasks store with indexes on dueDate, status, and projectId
- TimeBlocks store with indexes on startTime and userId
- Projects store with indexes on userId
- Sync queue for tracking pending changes

#### 4.2.2 Data Partitioning
- User-specific data isolation
- Time-based data partitioning for performance
- Size limits with automatic cleanup policies

## 5. Synchronization Mechanism

### 5.1 Sync Architecture

Sync process flow: Local changes are queued, conflicts are detected and resolved, then data is synchronized with the server. Server changes are pulled and similarly processed for conflict resolution before updating local storage.

### 5.2 Conflict Detection and Resolution

#### 5.2.1 Conflict Detection Strategy
- Version-based conflict detection using entity version fields
- Last-write-wins for simple conflicts
- User intervention for complex conflicts

#### 5.2.2 Resolution Algorithms
- Automatic resolution for timestamp-based conflicts
- Merge strategies for concurrent edits
- User prompts for unresolvable conflicts

### 5.3 Sync Triggers
- Automatic sync on network connectivity restoration
- Manual sync trigger
- Periodic background sync
- On-demand sync for critical operations

## 6. Progressive Web App Features

### 6.1 PWA Implementation

#### 6.1.1 Web App Manifest
- App metadata for installation
- Icons for various devices
- Theme colors and display preferences

#### 6.1.2 Service Worker Implementation
- Caching strategies for static assets
- Runtime caching for API responses
- Background sync for pending operations
- Push notifications support

### 6.2 Offline Functionality
- Full offline access to previously loaded data
- Ability to create, edit, and delete entities offline
- Visual indicators for offline status
- Sync status notifications

## 7. API Endpoints

### 7.1 Sync Endpoints

#### 7.1.1 Push Changes
Push endpoint for sending local changes to the server with conflict detection in the response.

#### 7.1.2 Pull Changes
Pull endpoint for retrieving server changes since a specific timestamp.

### 7.2 Conflict Resolution Endpoint
Endpoint for resolving conflicts with different resolution strategies.

## 8. Data Models and ORM Mapping

### 8.1 Version Fields
All entities will be enhanced with version tracking fields:

Entities will be extended with version tracking and last synced timestamp fields.

### 8.2 Sync Metadata
Additional tables for tracking sync state:

Additional database tables will track sync metadata and conflicts.

## 9. Business Logic

### 9.1 Offline Detection
- Network status monitoring
- Automatic switching between online/offline modes
- Graceful degradation of features

### 9.2 Data Validation
- Client-side validation before local storage
- Server-side validation on sync
- Conflict resolution validation

### 9.3 Performance Optimization
- Batch operations for sync
- Efficient querying of local data
- Memory management for large datasets

## 10. Testing Strategy

### 10.1 Unit Tests
- Offline storage operations
- Sync algorithm implementation
- Conflict resolution logic
- PWA feature functionality

### 10.2 Integration Tests
- End-to-end offline workflows
- Sync scenarios with conflict resolution
- Performance under various network conditions

### 10.3 Edge Cases
- Network interruptions during sync
- Large sync volumes
- Concurrent edits on multiple devices
- Storage limitations
- Browser compatibility

## 11. Security Considerations

### 11.1 Data Encryption
- Encryption of sensitive data in local storage
- Secure key management
- Data integrity checks

### 11.2 Authentication
- Token storage for offline access
- Secure session management
- Revocation handling

## 12. Performance Optimization
