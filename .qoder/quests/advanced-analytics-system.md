The Advanced Analytics System will extend the existing productivity tracking module to provide enhanced analytics capabilities including:
- Detailed time reporting with billable rate support
- AI-powered productivity insights
- Goal tracking with progress visualization
- Customizable report templates
- Multi-format data export (PDF, CSV, Excel)

### 1.3 Goals
- Enable users to view detailed reports on time spent for accurate client billing
- Provide actionable productivity insights based on user patterns
- Allow users to set and track productivity goals
- Enable generation of customizable reports
- Support exporting reports in multiple formats

## 2. Architecture

### 2.1 System Context
The Advanced Analytics System will be implemented as an extension of the existing Productivity Tracking module, leveraging its entities and services while adding new functionality.

The system architecture includes a frontend that communicates with the Analytics API, which in turn coordinates with various services including Analytics Service, Report Generation Service, Export Service, Insights Engine, and Goal Tracking Service, all backed by a Database.
