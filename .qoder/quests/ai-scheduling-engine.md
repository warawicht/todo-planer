# AI Scheduling Engine Design Document

## 1. Overview

The AI Scheduling Engine is an advanced feature for the todo-planer application that provides intelligent task scheduling suggestions, productivity pattern analysis, automatic task prioritization, and natural language processing for task creation. This system leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze user behavior patterns and provide personalized recommendations to optimize time management and productivity.

### 1.1 Purpose
The AI Scheduling Engine aims to:
- Provide smart scheduling suggestions based on user productivity patterns
- Analyze productivity trends and generate actionable insights
- Automatically prioritize tasks based on user behavior and preferences
- Enable task creation through natural language processing

### 1.2 Scope
This document covers the design and implementation of four core AI-powered features:
1. Scheduling suggestion engine
2. Productivity pattern analysis
3. Automatic task prioritization
4. Natural language processing for tasks

## 2. Architecture
