## 10. Testing Patterns and Anti-Patterns

### 10.1 Testing Patterns
- **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Clear test structure with setup, execution, and verification phases
- **Given-When-Then**: Behavior-driven testing approach for clear test scenarios
- **Test Data Builder**: Fluent interface for creating test data with default values
- **Object Mother**: Centralized test data creation with predefined scenarios
- **Test Hook**: Lifecycle methods for setup and teardown operations
- **Parameterized Tests**: Run same test logic with different input data
- **Contract Tests**: Verify interface contracts between components
- **Snapshot Tests**: Capture and verify component output automatically

### 10.2 Testing Anti-Patterns
- **Test Code Duplication**: Repeating setup code instead of using test utilities
- **Over-Mocking**: Mocking everything instead of testing real interactions
- **Brittle Tests**: Tests that break easily with minor implementation changes
- **Slow Tests**: Tests that take too long to execute, slowing down development
- **Test Order Dependency**: Tests that depend on execution order for success
- **Incomplete Coverage**: Missing edge cases and error conditions in tests
- **Magic Values**: Hardcoded values in tests instead of named constants
- **Testing Implementation Details**: Tests coupled to internal implementation rather than behavior

## 11. Test-Driven Development Practices

### 11.1 TDD Workflow
- **Red-Green-Refactor**: Write failing test, implement solution, refactor for quality
- **Baby Steps**: Implement functionality in small, incremental steps
- **Outside-In Development**: Start with acceptance tests, work down to unit tests
- **Mockist vs Classicist**: Choose mocking approach based on architectural preferences

### 11.2 TDD Benefits
- **Design Quality**: Better design through testability requirements
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation
- **Regression Prevention**: Immediate feedback on breaking changes
- **Confidence**: High confidence in code changes and refactoring

### 11.3 TDD Challenges
