- ✅ Client cookie clearing
- ✅ Success response

### 6. Session Management with Refresh Tokens
- ✅ Refresh endpoint (/auth/refresh) with POST method

- ✅ New tokens return to client with proper security headers

### 7. Rate Limiting
- ✅ Rate limiting middleware
- ✅ Rate limits configuration (e.g., 10 requests/minute)
- ✅ IP-based rate limiting
- ✅ User-based rate limiting
- ✅ Different limits for different endpoints
- ✅ Rate limit exceeded response
- ✅ Automatic rate limit reset after time window

### 8. Account Lockout
- ✅ Failed login attempt counter in User entity
- ✅ Failed login attempts tracking
- ✅ Lockout after 5 failed attempts
- ✅ Lockout duration setting (e.g., 30 minutes)
- ✅ Automatic unlock after time period
- ✅ Admin unlock capability
- ✅ Manual unlock by admin

## Partially Implemented Features

### Email Sending
The following email-related features have been designed but not fully implemented as they require external email service configuration:
- Send verification email to user
- Send password reset email with token link
- Send password change confirmation email
- Send lockout notification email

These features have TODO comments in the code where implementation would be added.
