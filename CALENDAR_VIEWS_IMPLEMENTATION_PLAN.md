# Calendar Views Implementation Plan

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for adding calendar views (day, week, month) to the todo-planer application based on the design requirements.

## Overview

The calendar views feature will provide users with different ways to visualize their schedule by implementing day, week, and month views with navigation controls and user preference saving capabilities.

## Implementation Phases

- Extend existing TimeBlock entity with view-specific formatting
- Implement user preferences storage logic

#### 1.3 Business Logic

- Add date navigation service
- Create view-specific data formatting logic (day/week/month)

### Phase 2: Frontend Implementation

#### 2.1 Core Views
- Implement Day View Component with time block positioning
- Implement Week View Component with daily columns
- Implement Month View Component with event indicators

#### 2.2 Navigation Controls
- Add previous/next navigation functionality
- Implement "Today" button
- Integrate date picker
- Add keyboard shortcuts for navigation

#### 2.3 User Preferences
- Implement view preference saving/loading
- Add default view setting
- Ensure cross-session consistency

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization

#### 3.1 Backend Optimization
- Implement database query optimizations
- Add caching strategy for frequently accessed date ranges
- Optimize queries to fetch only necessary fields

#### 3.2 Frontend Optimization
- Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets
- Add debouncing for navigation controls
- Implement request cancellation for rapid navigation
- Add lazy loading techniques

### Phase 4: Testing

#### 4.1 Unit Tests
- Calendar service tests (date range calculations, time block aggregation)
- User preferences service tests (saving/retrieval, validation)
- Date navigation service tests (navigation logic, edge cases)

#### 4.2 Integration Tests
- API endpoint tests (calendar data retrieval, preference management)
- Frontend component tests (view rendering, navigation controls)
- Performance tests (large dataset handling, responsiveness)
